/*
1.a Create an integer array with the values 
{ 8, 9, 1, 5, 11, 13, 7, 4, 6, 3, 12, 10, 2 } 
1.b implement your own sorting 
algorithm for the int[] array, by creating a method that takes in the int[] array and
loops through it with a for loop. for every step in the for loop, you must compare the
values of array[i] and array[i + 1] and swap them if [i] is greater than [i + 1]. 
1.c
call the method created in 1.b in a while loop from setup(), until the list is sorted. 
1.d Add a boolean to keep track of when the list is sorted to avoid creating an 
infinite loop.
