Today's exercises should be performed in IntelliJ. You are to create a new project titled "exercises41".
For each task below, you must create a new package in the project's src directory. Name it accordingly to the task,
e.g. "Task1". In each package, create a Main.java with a static Main method which will be used to call the methods
required to complete the tasks.

Please note, that it is quite unusual to have a Main class in each package, yet this is done so for the sake of the exercise.

package com.alainskoder;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	// write your code here
    }
}
